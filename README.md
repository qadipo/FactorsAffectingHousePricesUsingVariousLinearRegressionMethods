# Modelling House Prices Using Various Linear Regression Methods

This problem shall be approached as a data scientist, working for Hass Consulting Company which is a real estate leader with over 25 years of experience. The task involves studying factors that affect housing prices using the information on real estate properties that has been collected over the past few months. Thereafter we will create a model that would allow the company to accurately predict the sale of prices upon being provided with the predictor variables.

In building the Model, various regression techniques shall be considered with the performace of each evaluated to determine the suitability of each model. The following are the techniques that will be considered:

    1. Multiple Linear Regression
    2. Quantile Regression
    3. Ridge Regression
    4. Lasso Regression
    5. Elastic Net Regression
